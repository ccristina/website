  <strong> Mark your code</strong> with special tag <code>@@author</code> so that we can extract code written by each of
  you using the collate tool (for evaluation purposes). After that, Use the collate tool to extract individual code and
  look through the generated <strong> .md</strong> files to ensure all your code has been extracted correctly. <span
    class="highlighted">Push the *.md files created to a folder called /collated</span> in your repo. More instructions
  below. </p>
<p>
  <strong>Extract your code for code quality grading </strong>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Download <code>Collate-TUI.jar</code> from the <a href="https://github.com/se-edu/collate" target="_blank">Collate
    Tool project</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Mark your code with a <code>//@@author matric-number</code>. Note the double <code>@</code>. The comment syntax
    may vary based on file type e.g. for markdown, fxml, html
    <pre class="prettyprint"><code class="lang-html shell"><<!--\-->!-- @@author matric-number --></code></pre>
  </li>
  <p>
    Here is a sample code file:
  </p>

  <pre class="prettyprint"><code class="shell">//@@author A0909865T
method 1 ...
method 2 ...
//@@author A0702345U
method 3 ...
//@@author A0909865X
method 4 ...</code></pre>
  <li>
    The <code>//@@author</code> tag should appear only at the beginning of the code a person wrote. The code up to the
    next <code>//@@author</code> tag or the end of the file (whichever comes first) will be considered as was written
    by that author.<br>
    However, you may put an empty <code>//@@author   </code> (i.e. no matric number) to indicate the
    end of the code segment you wrote, if you don't know who wrote the code segment below yours. The author of that
    code segment can add the matric number to the empty tag later.
  </li>
  <li>
    If a method was written by more than one person, the <code>//@@author</code> tag should indicate the person who
    wrote most of that method. i.e., <code>//@@author</code> tag should not appear inside a method.<br>
    If some part of the code was done collectively, you should still divide it up to reflect the amount of work each
    person contributed. For example, if 3 people wrote 150 lines of code and put in equal effort in doing so,
    you can divide the methods among yourselves roughly 50 lines to each person.
    Once a code segment is allocated to one person, that person is responsible (and will be graded for)
    the quality of that code. If parts of that code was written by someone else and those parts are not of high quality,
    the designated author should refactor the code to make it high quality.<br>
    Tip: GitHub has a 'blame' feature and a 'history' feature that can help you determine who wrote a piece of code.
  </li>
  <li>
    Do not put the <code>//@@author</code> inside java header comments as only the content below that tag will be
    collated.
  </li>
  e.g. INCORRECT
  <pre class="prettyprint"><code class="shell">/**
  * Returns true if ...
  * @@author A0909865T
  */</code></pre>
  <br>
  e.g. CORRECT 
  <pre class="prettyprint"><code class="shell">//@@author A0909865T
/**
  * Returns true if ...
  */</code></pre>
  <br>
  <li>
    If you wrote a significant amount of code that was not used in the final product,
    <ul>
      <li>Create a folder called <code>{project root}/unused</code></li>
      <li>Move unused files to that folder (those files should contain unused code only)</li>
      <li>use <code>//@@author matric-number</code> to mark unused code in those files.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  e.g.
  <pre class="prettyprint"><code class="shell">//@@author A0909865T-unused
method 1 ...
method 2 ...</code></pre>
  Please put a comment in the code to explain why it was not used.
  <br>
  <li>
    The <code>//@@author</code> tag should be used to mark *all* code/test you claim credit for.
    There is no need to mark documentation files. <br>
    You will be penalized if you try to boost the length of your collated files using unethical means such as
    duplicating the same code in multiple places. In particular, do not copy-paste test cases to create redundant
    tests. Even repetitive code blocks within test methods should be extracted out as utility methods to
    reduce code duplication.<br>
    Individual members are responsible for making sure their own collated files contain the correct content.
    <br>If you notice a team member claiming credit for code that he/she did not write, you can email us
    (after the final submission) to let us know.
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong> INCLUDE</strong>: everything that required significant ‘writing’ effort. e.g. comments,
      test code, styling (e.g. css), xml, even test data files. But do not include chunks of text
      that were trivially copy pasted e.g. a test data file with 1000 tasks that was used to test performance.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong> Code you reused </strong>from elsewhere: Mark such code as <code>//@@author matric-number-reused</code>
    </li>
    e.g.
    <pre class="prettyprint"><code class="shell">//@@author A0909865T-reused
method 1 ...
method 2 ...</code></pre>
    where the matric number belongs to the person responsible for reusing that code.<br>
    Note that you can claim segments of sample code as your own if you have done non-trivial changes to that
    code segment. Renaming is a trivial change, but adapting an AddressBook GUI test to work for your project
    is a non-trivial change.
    <li>
      <strong> EXCLUDE</strong> code generated by the IDE/framework. You may also mark such code
      <code>//@@author generated</code></li>
    e.g.
    <pre class="prettyprint"><code class="shell">//@@author generated
method 1 ...
method 2 ...</code></pre>
  </ul>
  <li>
    You need to put the,
    <ul>
      <li>collated functional code in <code>collated/main</code> folder,</li>
      <li>collated test code in <code>collated/test</code> folder, and</li>
      <li>collated unused code in <code>collated/unused</code> folder</li>
    </ul>
    Given below are DOS sample commands you can put in a batch file and run it to collate the code.
  <pre class="prettyprint"><code class="shell">
java -jar Collate-TUI.jar collate from src/main to collated/main include java, fxml, css

java -jar Collate-TUI.jar collate from src/test to collated/test include java

java -jar Collate-TUI.jar collate from unused to collated/unused include java, fxml, css</code></pre>
  The output should be something like the structure given below.
    <pre class="prettyprint"><code class="shell">
collated/
    main/
      A000000.md
      A111111.md
      A222222.md
      A222222reused.md
    test/
      A000000.md
      A111111.md
      A222222.md
    unused/
      A000000.md
    </code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
  Remember to stage and push the <code>collated</code> folder and files   
  created above to your team's repo. 
  </li>
</ol>
