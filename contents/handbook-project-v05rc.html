<h3>V0.5rc Product</h3>
<p>
  Functionality expectations: <strong> Freeze features</strong> after reaching this milestone.
  As this is a ‘release candidate’ it should have all the features you intend to release.
  Adding more features after this point is risky. The remaining time should be left
  aside for fixing problems discovered late.<br>
  Other suggestions:
<ul>
  <li>Dogfood your product intensively and improve it based on your findings.</li>
  <li>Bring code coverage near to your target if it is low.</li>
  <li>After you have sufficient code coverage, fix remaining code quality problems and bring up the
    quality to the level you target.
  </li>
</ul>


<h3>V0.5rc Documentation</h3>
<div id="handbook-project-v05rc-documentation"></div>
<p>
  Recommended to update the documentation to match the product.

<h3>V0.5rc Demo</h3>
<div id="handbook-project-v05rc-demo">
<p>
  <strong>Submission</strong>: To be done during the tutorial, but note the following:
<ul>
  <li>Duration: 10 minutes (max)</li>
  <li>It <span class="highlighted">should be a 'well prepared' demo</span>.
    You should know in advance exactly what you'll do in the demo.</li>
  <li>It should be a full demo: Cover all features you have, not just features you added recently.</li>
  <li>It is a 'sitting down' demo: As before, you'll be demonstrating the features using the TV while sitting down.</li>
  <li>Tutor will not interrupt you during the demo. That means you should finish within the given time.</li>
  <li>It should be done by 2 members (i.e. one person do the first half, the other do the 2nd half).<br>
  If you are not taking part in this demo, you must take part in V0.5 demo.<br>
    One or more persons can do the typing for the whole demo. Speaking should be done by the two designated
    to do the demo.</li>
  <li>The app should be populated with a significant amount of realistic data at the start.
    e.g data going back to at least two weeks and up to two weeks in future, about 50 items in total.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  <strong>Submission</strong>: as before.

<p>
  <strong>Grading</strong>: Your product should show significant progress since the previous milestone. This is a hard-deadline! Please make sure that we can grade your V0.5rc in your repo.
