<p>
  <strong>Timing/venue</strong>: Mon, 10:00 - 12:00 and Wed, 10:00 - 12:00 in SR2 (COM1-204).
  Lectures start at 10:00 sharp and end around 11:45.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Attendance</strong>: Attendance for the <span class="highlighted">first lecture is compulsory</span>.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Webcast</strong>: no webcast for the lectures.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Handouts</strong>: Each lecture consists of 3-5 sections, supported by separate handouts.
  Links to handouts for a lecture will be <span class="highlighted">added before the lecture</span>.
  You are welcome to, but not required to, read through them before attending the lecture.
</p>
<p>
  <span class="highlighted">Read before tutorials</span>: You are required to read the relevant handouts and ponder
  how to apply those concepts in your project before attending the corresponding tutorial (except for Tutorial 0 on Mon, 19 Jun). If you have any followup
  questions about handouts, please post in IVLE forums or ask during tutorials (if there is spare time).
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Post-lecture quizzes</strong>:
  Each lecture will be followed by an IVLE quiz that can earn you participation points.
  <br>
  Purpose: for you to self-test how well you understood the handouts and other “required” readings (if any).
  <br>
  You can keep taking the quiz until you get full marks. We count the best effort only.
  <br>
  IVLE quizzes open  after the lecture and closes on the following day.
  <br>
  Post-lecture quizzes are <span class="highlighted">counted for <a href="#handbook-participation">participation marks</a></span>.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Slides</strong>: Because we are giving separate handouts, lecture slides do not contain content that you can
  print and use as a reference during the lecture or the exams. Instead, handouts serve as the main exam reference while
  slides will play only a supporting role during lecture delivery. <span
    class="highlighted">Slides will be uploaded</span> <em>after</em> the lecture.
