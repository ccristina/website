<strong>When to form teams</strong>
<ul>
  <li>CS2103: Form tentative teams in week 1 (during first tutorial). Finalize the team in the subsequent
    tutorial. 
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong> Team size</strong>: The default <span class="highlighted">team size is four</span>.
  Please do not form teams with five or more.
</p>
<p>
  <strong> Team ID</strong>: This will be given to you after forming teams in each phase. It has the form
  <code>TUTORIAL_ID-TEAM_NUMBER</code> e.g, <code>T1-2</code> means you are in
  tutorial T1 team 2.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Team composition</strong>
</p>

<!--We allow some freedom in choosing team members, subject to these constraints: -->
<ul>
  
  <li>
    All team members should be in the same tutorial. <span class="highlighted">Delay forming teams until
    your place in a tutorial is confirmed.</span>
    We do not allow changing tutorials to team up with your preferred team mates.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Also note that we may modify teams when circumstances call for it. There is no avenue for you to object.
    Staying with your preferred team is not guaranteed.
  </li>
</ul>
