    <strong>Where is everything?</strong> CS2103-related information are mainly in one of these two places:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong><a href="schedule.html">The Schedule page</a></strong> (organized chronologically): 
        <span class="highlighted">That is the one page you need to refer for every session.</span>.
    </li>
	<li>
		<strong><a class="href" target="content"
	 href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e2vXoGSVrcyq4qx5Y8KGLdEsDeEJ8Y8nbe-4Ln0cm4E/pub?embedded=true">One-page schedule</a></strong> 
	 - a schematic view of the schedule. You may use this page to have a brief overview of the important deadlines and grading for the module.
	</li>
    <li>
        <strong>Module handbook</strong> (i.e. this page. organized by topic) This is a reference document supplementary 
        to the schedule page. This page contains a lot of text, probably too much to read in one sitting. Instead, 
        <span class="highlighted">skim through it quickly to learn what it contains</span>. You can come back to read 
        details as-and-when the need arises. The schedule page lists relevant sections of the Handbook you 
        should read at various points.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>No reminder emails</strong>: We try to minimize sending module details via announcements. 
    The reason will be explained in lecture 1.
